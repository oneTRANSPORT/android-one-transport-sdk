2 How many cars entered and left Silverstone during the period?  (Summary)

(* How many cars entered and left each car park?)

1 When were the busiest periods for each car park?  (Max/min throughput)

3 Keys could be car park, day, hour, minute, direction.

1 Count cars filling each car park?  (Max/min occupancy)

* How long do people stay, by car park?  (Not possible?)

Paths: (rule: no mixing of containers and content instances?)

The total number of car movements over the period for a given car park:

  /sensors/sensorN/total/{"in":NNN,"out":NNN}

Car park data divided up by 15-minute time intervals and by sensor.  At the lowest
level, we provide the number of cars going in, out and the occupancy at the end of
the interval.

  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/hourN/mins0-14/{"in":NNN,"out":NNN,"occupancy-end":NNN}
  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/hourN/mins15-29/{"in":...}
  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/hourN/mins30-44/{"in":...}
  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/hourN/mins45-59/{"in":...}

Then, moving up to summarising by hour and by day, we also include the maximum and
minimum values of each 15-minute interval, along with totals for the whole hour and day.

  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/hourN/hour/
                                 {"total-in":NNN,"total-out":NNN,"occupancy-end":NNN,
                                  "min-in":NNN,"min-out":NNN,"min-occupancy":NNN,
                                  "max-in":NNN,"max-out":NNN,"max-occupancy":NNN}
  /sensors/sensorN/day2016-07-NN/day/{"total-in":...}

We can do the same thing for totals, the sum of all car park sensors.

  /total/total/{"total-in":NNN,"total-out":NNN}
  /total/day2016-07-NN/day/{"total-in":NNN,"total-out":NNN,"occupancy-end":NNN,
                            "min-in":NNN,"min-out":NNN,"min-occupancy":NNN,
                            "max-in":NNN,"max-out":NNN,"max-occupancy":NNN}
  /total/day2016-07-NN/hourN/hour/{"total-in":...}
  /total/day2016-07-NN/hourN/minsNN-NN/{"in":NNN,"out":NNN,"occupancy-end":NNN}
