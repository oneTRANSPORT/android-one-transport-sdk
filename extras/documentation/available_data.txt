What data is available?
=======================

Data sources are provided by county and by data type, but note that there
is a fair amount of overlap between the regions and counties may control
items outside their boundaries.  For example, Northamptonshire has variable
message signs near Luton and Leicester.  We suggest consuming all the feeds
for the items in which you are interested and then filtering geographically
if needed.

Also, not every county provides every type of data.  These feeds are
available:

> ### Buckinghamshire
> > Car parks, events, traffic flow, traffic queue, traffic scoot, traffic
> > speed, traffic travel time, roadworks, variable message signs

> ### Hertfordshire
> > Car parks, events, traffic flow, traffic scoot, traffic
> > speed, traffic travel time, roadworks, variable message signs

> ### Northamptonshire

> > variable message signs

> ### Oxfordshire
> > Car parks, events, traffic flow, traffic queue, traffic scoot, traffic
